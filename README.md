# 🏁 Formula 1 Business Intelligence Dashboard

This Power BI project was developed as part of a **Business Intelligence Assessment by Impetus Technologies**. The goal was to analyze Formula 1 race data from the Ergast Developer API and build a fully functional, interactive dashboard showcasing insights about races, drivers, teams, and circuits.

## 📝 Assessment Overview (from Impetus)

- Analyze F1 racing data and build dashboards to showcase performance metrics.
- Use at least 4 related tables from the Ergast F1 dataset (e.g., races, drivers, constructors, circuits, results).
- Create a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard.
- Incorporate KPIs, calculated columns, slicers, and cross-chart interactivity.
- Explain relationships in the data model and apply suitable visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Power BI (DAX, data modeling, slicers, relationships)
